  db.put "it", "works"               # => "works"
  db.get "it"                        # => "works"

  db["hello"] = "there"              # => "there"
  db["hello"]                        # => "there"

  db["nonexistent"]                  # => nil

  ## iterating
  db.each { |k, v| ... }
  db.map { |k, v| ... }
